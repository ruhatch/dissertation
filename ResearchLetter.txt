Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Rupert Horlick and I am an undergraduate Computer Scientist at the University of Cambridge. I am researching ideas for my final year project and am looking to build a prototype of a standalone product that would be of direct use in the field of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. I want to push the boundaries with an innovative, exciting idea that can be achieved over the course of a few months. I would be grateful if you could answer a few questions, to help me get started.

Firstly, which do you think are the most promising areas of PET, that are producing real-world solutions at present?

Which situations or groups of people could be most affected by the advancement of PET? Are you aware of any specific groups of people that are currently overlooked but could benefit from PET?

Do you have any ideas for specific products that could form the basis of my project?

Finally, are there any resources (reading material, existing technologies etc.) that you would recommend for getting into this kind of work?  

Any other advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this, any response at all would be extremely valued.

Yours sincerely,

Rupert
