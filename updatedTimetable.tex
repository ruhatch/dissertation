\section*{Timetable: Work plan and Milestones}

Planned starting date is 16/10/2015.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf 16/10/15 -- 26/10/15} Familiarise myself with relevant Mirage libraries. Implement basic Path ORAM functor.

\item {\bf 27/10/15 -- 09/11/15} Implement basic test harness. Start implementation of object store.

\item {\bf 10/11/15 -- 23/11/15} Finish object store and use it to build more complex tests of the ORAM.

\item {\bf 24/11/15 -- 04/12/15} Add recursion and statelessness to the ORAM.

\item {\bf 05/12/15 -- 18/12/15} Write up implementation section of the dissertation for all parts completed so far.

\item {\bf 18/12/15 -- 31/12/15} Write the search module and design tests for it.

\item {\bf 01/01/16 -- 08/01/16} Write implementation section for the search module.

\item {\bf 09/01/16 -- 12/01/16} Incorporate encryption library and write up its section of the implementation.

\item {\bf 13/01/16 -- 29/01/16} Perform functional evaluation of the project, including unit tests and randomised testing. Write the progress report.

\item {\bf 30/01/16 -- 08/02/16} Perform performance testing of the project, including micro-benchmarks for optimisation and macro-benchmarks for comparison with theoretical performance bounds.

\item {\bf 09/02/16 -- 21/02/16} Perform security analysis, including testing the access patterns for randomness and ensuring the independence of subsequent accesses to the same location. Write up the evaluation section, achieving a complete first draft.

\item {\bf 22/02/16 -- 06/03/16} Submit first draft to supervisors for feedback and modify based on feedback. (Begin extensions if choosing to do them).

\item {\bf 07/03/16 -- 11/03/16} Perform further evaluation and refinement as necessary.

\item {\bf 12/03/16 -- 25/03/16} Write final draft of dissertation and then leave it until submission time, in order to focus on revision.

\item {\bf 01/05/16 -- 13/05/16} Reread and make any final edits and then submit.

\end{enumerate}

\textit{Updated on 01/02/16 to reflect small changes.}
